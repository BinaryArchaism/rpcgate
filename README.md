> **rpcgate** â€” self-hosted open-source proxy and load balancer for EVM RPC providers.

rpcgate lets you run your own lightweight gateway that connects to multiple Ethereum-compatible RPC providers.  
It increases reliability, provides unified access across chains, and exposes metrics for observability.
